# twitter-swarm-feed
Very simple miner that targets public swarm checkins shared in twitter. I redirect mine to another application to mimic the Swarm push API, but it's your choice really.

## What you need to run
1. A twitter application (for consumer key, secret)
2. You authorizing your application (for access token key, secret)
3. A swarm oauth token (make a swarm app and just copy the token from the "test app" page)
